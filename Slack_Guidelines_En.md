# Slack Guidelines

## Introduction
We use Slack as our company-wide communication tool in Mercari. The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure information about a project or team communication is done smoothly and efficiently.

## Premise
- Keep Openness in mind
    - In order to decrease communication costs and maintain our Openness culture, we communicate openly (except for personal information or insider information). - However, we don’t prohibit the use of private messages or private channels when necessary. Employees are free to invite, join, and leave channels as they see fit.
- Understand chat communication has its limits
    - Sometimes, text communication is not able to fully convey one’s thoughts. In such cases we should use other communication methods (Ex: In-person discussion, conference call on Google Hangouts, etc.).
- Be respectful
    - Don’t hesitate to share your opinions because we value Openness, but be considerate toward other people and remember “All for One.”

## Policies
- Accounts
    - All group company members 
    - Specific external people
- Mentions
    - Before mentioning @here/@channel in channels with many people, consider whether or not it’s needed.
    - It is the members' responsibility to adjust mention settings for evenings, weekends, etc. 
- Channels
    - Anyone can make a channel
    - Please be sure to write the purpose when creating a new channel
- Administrators
    - Account Administrator
    - IT Service Team

- Restrictions & points to remember
    - Only post messages in line with that channel’s purpose
    - Only make announcements in separate “all company” channels when appropriate considering location (Tokyo/Sendai/Fukuoka), etc.
    - Don’t discuss highly confidential information (passwords, personal information, etc.)
    - Continuously review each Slack channel’s usage is in line its purpose 
    - Set the channel to Private when discussing personal information or insider information 
- Closing channels
    - Review Slack channels regularly, and close temporary or non-active channels
    - On ”Slack Cleanup Day” (at the end of every quarter) review and close channels when possible

## Usage for Specific external people
If communicating on Slack is the most efficient option, make an account for specific non-employees. 
- Accounts
    - People on loan from other companies
    - Outside guests
- Account types
    - Single-Channel Guest
        - When someone joins a specific project and 1 channel
- Restricted User
    - When someone joins multiple channels but does not need access to all open channels
        - Difference from regular employee: User can join channels only when invited
        - Difference from Single-Channel account: Person can join multiple channels
