# Slack Guidelines

## Introduction
We use Slack as our company-wide communication tool in Mercari. The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure information about a project or team communication is done smoothly and efficiently.

## Premise
- **Keep Openness in mind**
    - In order to decrease communication costs and maintain our Openness culture, we communicate openly (except for personal information or insider information). - However, we don’t prohibit the use of private messages or private channels when necessary. Employees are free to invite, join, and leave channels as they see fit.
- **Understand chat communication has its limits**
    - Sometimes, text communication is not able to fully convey our thoughts. In such cases it can be better to deliberately increase the number of times you exchange messages with the person you are communicating with, and to proactively use other communication methods as well (such as meeting in person and conference calls using Google Meet).
    - Communication using text alone can make it hard to express your feelings; it can also be hard for the recipient to interpret the intended meaning of your message. Because Slack messages are largely composed of only text, the recipient does not have access to the nuances that would otherwise be conveyed by your intonation or facial expressions. Make sure you understand the limits of text communication to convey emotion, and proactively do things like use a lot of emojis and reactions, engage in conversations where you and the other party’s facial expressions are visible, such as meeting in person or teleconferencing with Google Meet.
        - When people communicate, verbal communication (what the person says) comprises only 7% of their message while what the recipient hears, including such things as tone of voice, make up 38%, and what they see, such as facial expressions, make up 55% of what is communicated (according to Mehrabian's Communication Model [also known as the 7-38-55 rule]).
- **Be respectful**
    - Don’t hesitate to share your opinions because we value Openness, but be considerate toward other people and remember “All for One.”
- **Recipients of information adjust their timing to read when best for them**
    - Given that working locations and time are more and more diverse, we ask recipients to control their time not to check Slack regularly (e.g. at night, on your days off).
        - Turn off notifications of Slack where you think required.
        - If your working hours are predetermined, let members know in advance through 1on1 or Workstyle Sync.
    - As a pro, strike a balance between the smooth exchange of information for performance and time away from work to refresh yourself.
        - To help recover from work fatigue, it is sometimes helpful to take physical/psychological distances from work (psychological detachment) .
    - When you put yourself in the shoes of a sender, be aware that people check Slack messages at different times, and do not expect an immediate response from recipients.
        - You may need to plan in advance how to proceed with your work and make sure to have enough time for essential  tasks (i.e. allow recipients a few days before the deadline for responses)

## Policies
- Accounts
    - All group company members 
    - Specific external people
- Mentions
    - Before mentioning @here/@channel in channels with many people, consider whether or not it’s needed.
    - It is the recipients' responsibility to adjust mention settings for evenings, weekends, etc.
- Channels
    - Anyone can make a channel
    - Please be sure to write the purpose when creating a new channel
- Creating custom emojis
    - Anyone can create emojis on Slack
    - Please be respectful when creating and using custom emojis. Avoid creating emojis with images that can be seen as discriminatory, disrespectful, violent, or harmful, such as emojis using Nazi symbolism or controversial political figures.
        - **Note that different images may be considered disrespectful depending on the culture/group. Remember that we are in a multicultural environment and that there are people from many different backgrounds working alongside you.**
        - Examples of inappropriate emojis:
            - Pepe the Frog, an internet meme appropriated as a symbol of the alt-right movement in the US
            - The Nazi flag or representations of Adolf Hitler
            - Emoji using the rainbow flag to represent violence against LGBT+ individuals
            - The Rising Sun Flag, today used in Japan to cheer at sports, but viewed by other countries as a reminder of Japan's atrocities during World War II
